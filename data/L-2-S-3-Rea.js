    const storyText = `"Clay" did not get a good night's sleep; he awoke suddenly to a muffled growl that shook the walls of his tent. Opening his eyes, he found himself face to face with a living nightmare: a massive wolf was standing at the entrance of his narrow tent, its large head facing inwards.

Terror paralyzed "Clay" completely. He, who trembled at the mere sight of a pet dog, now found himself at the mercy of a wolf whose fangs gleamed in the darkness. The beast advanced, then suddenly lunged for his neck in a swift motion. Instinctively, "Clay" raised his arm to protect his face, but the wolf sank its teeth into his flesh. "Clay's" mind could not bear this combination of physical pain and psychological terror, and the world went dark before his eyes as he succumbed to a deep coma.

The next day, "Clay" opened his eyes, hardly believing he had survived for the second time. His body still trembled from the shock, but he began to calm down as he took in his surroundings. He was not in his cramped tent, but in a luxurious, meticulously maintained one; its roof was intricately carved, and its walls were adorned with animal hides.

A young woman in her twenties stood with her back to him, intently engaged in some task. She wore a dress resembling an Indian robe, its color a captivating gold, and a long black braid cascaded down her back.

The woman turned, carrying a bowl of hot soup, and walked steadily toward him. The tent was lit by oil lamps, and as she drew closer, "Clay" saw a beautiful girl with fair skin, fine eyebrows, and long eyelashes. But as she drew nearer, he saw the girl had no eyes. Her eyelids were deeply closed, and her sockets were empty.

"Clay" felt a pang in his heart; beauty, as they say, is never perfect. He felt sorry for her, and as he tried to sit up, he felt a prickling sensation in his arm. He found that the wolf bite had been carefully bandaged. "Clay" froze in place as the girl approached him with a confident, unwavering gait and placed the pot of soup directly into his lap without spilling a single drop. His heart leapt in terror at the sheer precision; how could a blind woman locate him and his lap so easily, as if she could see him clearly? Even more astonishing, she took two steps back and sat on a chair directly behind her without feeling for it, then the most beautiful smile spread across her face.`;
