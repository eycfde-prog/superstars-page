These people, no more than thirty in total, were fleeing injustice after their village fell to their enemies. They wandered through the snowy wastelands, carrying the remnants of their provisions and spirits that were weary from their long journey. Eventually, they reached a valley nestled between two mountains.

They decided to camp there for a few days. However, a violent earthquake struck, unleashing a torrent of rocks and snow. This disaster sealed off the gaps and turned the mountains around them into giant walls. The first generation of survivors tried to climb the peaks, but the instability meant either a fall that would end their lives or the waiting jaws of wolves.

As they resigned themselves to their fate and decided to settle permanently, a mysterious virus infected their eyes. They tried to isolate themselves to find a cure, but they failed.

Their history then took a new turn; instead of mourning their lost light, they decided to develop an alternative "vision." Over the years and through many generations, they became much quieter. Their ears became like radars, picking up the tiniest details, and their movements slowed down to avoid tripping. As the sense of sight diminished, human nature began to adapt. With each new birth, the eyebrows became more prominent and the sockets receded inward. Generation after generation, the eyes themselves disappeared, leaving only thin lines and eyelashes.

For the descendants of these migrants, the concept of "sight" became a mere myth, a relic of their ancestors' legends. They considered protruding, open eyes a characteristic reserved only for animals and predatory beasts.`;
